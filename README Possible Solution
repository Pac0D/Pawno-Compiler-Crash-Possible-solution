Go to : 

https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler/releases

Try using with each of these versions and compiling.

If this did not work for you, repeat this process again but remove #includes as an example some anti cheat..

Example :

Download a version of pawn

and remove


#nex-ac

Compile


Remove

#streamer and compile

If you did this with all the #includes and it didn't compile try another version of pawn and so on
